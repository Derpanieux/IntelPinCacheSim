# IntelPinCacheSim
A simple cache simulator for use with Intel PIN. Simulates a data cache with a LRU replacement policy.
The size, associativity, and block size of the cache is configurable using commandline options.
To use this tool, replace the MyPinTool.cpp file in source/tools/MyPinTool with this one, or you can rename it and modify the make rules.
